# Ball-Beam Modeling Source of Truth (Redirect)

Canonical modeling document:
- `docs/modeling.md`

Compatibility note:
- This file is intentionally kept as a redirect so older links/bookmarks continue to work.
- All mathematical derivations, controller design calculations, and validation workflow now live in `docs/modeling.md`.

Measured-parameter worked calculations:
- `docs/modeling_measured_calculations_v1.md`
